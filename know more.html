        <h2>My Journey & Goals</h2>

        <p>
          I started my coding journey as a curious student who was excited to create his own website. At first, I didn‚Äôt
          know what HTML or CSS even meant. But with time, tutorials, and a lot of practice, I began to enjoy the
          process of building, fixing, and designing web pages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I know how to build simple websites using HTML and CSS. I‚Äôm also learning JavaScript and Python, and I
          enjoy trying out small projects and seeing how everything works behind the scenes. Coding has become something
          I genuinely enjoy.
        </p>
